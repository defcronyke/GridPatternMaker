GridPatternMaker has been tested on Arch Linux x86_64 and Windows 7 x86_64.

Here are instructions for running it on Linux and Windows.

Linux Instructions
==================
You have either the binary or the source release. Please follow the 
corresponding instructions.

Binary Release Instructions:

    You'll need to install these Dependencies:
        SDL 2.x
        SDL2_image
        wxwidgets 3.0.x

    Then just run the gridpatternmaker binary.


Source Release Instructions:

    Install Build Dependencies (you'll need the dev packages of these on some distros):
        7-Zip
        A C++11 compiler
        CMake 2.8.10 or newer
        SDL 2.x
        SDL2_image
        wxwidgets 3.0.x

    To Compile and Run:
        mkdir -p build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make
        cd ..
        build/gridpatternmaker&

--> **To make a Linux binary-only release from the Source Release**:
        Make sure CMakeLists.txt has this line uncommented:
            set (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release)
            And make sure the similar Debug line is commented out.
		
        ./make_linux_bin_release.sh
        The build directory will now contain a new .tar.7z file, which is a
        binary-only release version of GridPatternMaker.

Windows Instructions
====================
Binary Release Instructions:
    
    Run gridpatternmaker.exe, or create a shortcut for it somewhere.


Source Release Instructions:
    
    Builds with MinGW and CMake
    
    Install these build dependencies (all in default locations):

            Unzip to C:\

        wxwidgets 3.0.x
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.0/wxMSW-3.0.0-Setup.exe/download
            Compile:
                cd C:\wxWidgets-3.0.0\build\msw
                mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc SHARED=1 UNICODE=1 BUILD=release

    Open a console and cd into the project directory, then type: 
        64-bit
            make_win64_bin_release.bat
        
        32-bit
            make_win32_bin_release.bat
    
    The build directory will now contain a new .7z file, which is a binary-only 
    release version of GridPatternMaker.
